# noisemaker-for-qt: compatibility report

## 1. Source and authority revisions

Daily review: 2026-09-25. Current inspected source: [`1dd0a0b49b13a9e84ecc365770a1fb83fd01edd5`](https://github.com/noisefactorllc/noisemaker-for-qt/commit/1dd0a0b49b13a9e84ecc365770a1fb83fd01edd5).
Full rendered parity remains **unverified**. No release approval or new closure follows from this review.
Current upstream discovery: `bbdeb56c4b75cf33379766c3e87b0f5a18bcbba8`. Published Noisemaker authority: `1.0.179`, source `fca611fd8f91424661d4e531d39313d24ea21134`, 210 effect IDs.
The observations below retain their original source and authority identities; they do not qualify later updates.
Current served kit: `0.1.42`, source `bd8f4b71f756ddaca9cd04c4159f0e608460517e`. [Retrieved inventory and hashes](/Users/alex/.codex/automations/noisemaker-port-completion-audit/review-20260925-053200/current-served-inventories.json). Artifact identity does not establish host qualification.

### Earlier source observations

Report date: 2026-09-24. Source inspected: [`8460cfd77798d4e79d37828c16b0b29a09fbdbda`](https://github.com/noisefactorllc/noisemaker-for-qt/commit/8460cfd77798d4e79d37828c16b0b29a09fbdbda).
Full rendered parity at this SHA: **unverified**. This is not a release approval.
A later documentation-only commit does not change this tested source identity.
Any runtime, package, or authority update requires fresh evidence before this report can qualify it.

Qt 6 C++17 library, offscreen CLI, and QOpenGLWidget viewer using desktop OpenGL. Compiler structure and rendered parity are separate contracts. [Source contract](https://github.com/noisefactorllc/noisemaker-for-qt/blob/8460cfd77798d4e79d37828c16b0b29a09fbdbda/README.md).

Latest status entry records upstream `5b81e04f8a4b53c2be43b8e328cee0c3365f352f`. Historical render tables refer to older authority snapshots.
Current upstream discovery SHA: `c9ee8a049b2b63cd300da67c01ee40baf29dc288`.
Published authority: `1.0.176`, source `c9ee8a049b2b63cd300da67c01ee40baf29dc288`.
[Immutable published manifest](https://shaders.noisedeck.app/1.0.176/effects/manifest.json) contains 210 effect IDs.
Its SHA-256 is `05c4d7b7744837ae90a3bb4c89e5403ff09448a74d9d7e824abb3d719ad3314e`.
These IDs do not define complete parameter, state, input, or platform coverage.

Served kit `0.1.17` records `8460cfd77798d4e79d37828c16b0b29a09fbdbda`. [Source metadata](https://kits.noisedeck.app/qt/0/deployment-meta.json).
Historical measurements remain bound to their original revisions in [completion gaps](COMPLETION_GAPS.md).

## 2. Host and distribution matrix

Current tests and qualification limits are in [section 3](#3-parity-coverage).
The matrix below retains the earlier measured scope. A historical verified row is not a current-source or full-platform certification.

| Dimension | Status | Measured scope or limit |
|---|---|---|
| Source-level checks | verified | 31 Python harness tests passed. A later rebuild passed 12 C++ tests and rendered noise. Full GPU and installed-viewer qualification remain open. |
| Actual host rendering | verified | Only the bounded probes in section 3 executed. This is not full host qualification. |
| Minimum and current host versions | unverified | Declared requirements are not a tested version matrix. |
| Supported operating systems and backends | unverified | This pass does not establish Windows, Linux, and macOS coverage. |
| Installed package and first useful result | unverified | Complete isolated installation was not qualified for this source. |
| Parameters, external inputs, state, and chains | unverified | Full current-authority combinations remain unmeasured. |
| Invalid input and recovery | unverified | Unit checks do not establish every installed public entry point. |
| Upgrade, removal, and resource cleanup | unverified | Prior defects and missing workflows remain in the gap register. |
| Accessibility of provided controls | unverified | Keyboard, focus, labels, and diagnostics need host observations where applicable. |
| Release readiness | blocked | Full parity, installation, host, and artifact evidence remain incomplete. |

## 3. Parity coverage

### Daily review, 2026-09-25

Exact-source CI passes 25 C++ tests on Linux and Windows; macOS runs 24 plus the separate device-limits test. The five compiler stages each pass 388 cases. The llvmpipe suite accepts 362 fixture programs at its existing numerical contracts. Of 360 static records, 359 have maximum difference 0 and bloom has maximum difference 1. Two further programs exercise timed samples. NM_REFERENCE_OVERLAYS=1 supplies the reference overlays for fibers, scratches, and strayHair; those rows do not qualify the port-generated canvas. Local harness tests pass 54 of 54. Full parameter and platform parity remains unverified. [Raw evidence](/Users/alex/.codex/automations/noisemaker-port-completion-audit/review-20260925-053200/qt-ci-36095317236.log).

The current full case denominator remains incomplete. Missing parameters, hosts, external inputs, and stateful sequences remain qualification gaps. No skip or tolerated difference counts as exact parity.

### Earlier measurements

Full parity requires complete applicable coverage with no skips or missing cases.
Historical NEAR, CHAOS, and tolerated differences do not count as strict equality.
The existing numerical contracts remain separate from exact comparison. This report does not change tolerances or goldens.
Unknown values mean `not measured`, never zero.

| Gate | Expected cases | Executed | Strict passes | Failures | Skips | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Current full render suite | not measured | not measured | not measured | not measured | not measured | unverified |

Earlier served compatibility inventory declares 203 effect IDs. Declaration does not establish execution or parity.
IDs absent from the served declaration: `filter/text`, `render/meshLoader`, `render/meshRender`, `synth/media`, `synth/roll`, `synth/scope`, `synth/spectrum`.
Missing effects remain visible toward the full-parity goal. Contract exclusions do not become successful tests.

These probes use current candidate sources and retained golden files. Their historical authority provenance remains unresolved in this pass.
They do not qualify the current upstream revision or full catalog. Exact comparison uses zero byte tolerance.

| Probe | Evidence | Exact comparison |
|---|---|---|
| `noise` | [Retained-golden measurement](/Users/alex/.codex/automations/noisemaker-port-completion-audit/evidence-20260924-remaining-gap-documents/qt-noise-comparison.json) | failed |

Current served declaration: 210 effect IDs. This inventory is not evidence of execution. The declaration column below reflects kit `0.1.42`.

### Native observations, 2026-09-24

Rebuilt Qt desktop OpenGL runtime, with 12 of 12 C++ tests passing. 1 selected fixtures rendered. Exact comparison: 0 passes and 1 differences.
The graphs and goldens are retained historical inputs. Their full authority provenance remains unresolved in this pass.
These results do not qualify current upstream parity. Exact comparison uses zero byte tolerance.
Existing tolerance-based acceptance remains separate. No tolerance or golden changed.

| Inventory | Fixtures | Executed | Exact passes | Exact differences | Not executed | Full qualification |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tracked program files | 347 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 346 | unverified |

Every unexecuted fixture remains visible in the [fixture inventory](/Users/alex/.codex/automations/noisemaker-port-completion-audit/evidence-20260924-remaining-gap-documents/qt-fixture-inventory.json).
Fixture counts do not prove coverage of every current effect, parameter, or stateful workflow.

| Case | Exact result | Measurement | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `noise` | failed | [FAIL] noise: max-abs-diff=1.000 mean-abs-diff=0.0000 ssim=1.00000 (tol=0.0, ssim_min=0.98) | [Raw command](/Users/alex/.codex/automations/noisemaker-port-completion-audit/evidence-20260924-remaining-gap-documents/qt-noise-comparison-command.json) |

## 4. Evidence

[Bounded test evidence](/Users/alex/.codex/automations/noisemaker-port-completion-audit/evidence-20260924-remaining-gap-documents/qt-tests.json). [Exact-source Actions](https://github.com/noisefactorllc/noisemaker-for-qt/actions?query=head_sha%3A8460cfd77798d4e79d37828c16b0b29a09fbdbda).
[This run evidence](/Users/alex/.codex/automations/noisemaker-port-completion-audit/evidence-20260924-remaining-gap-documents) retains commands, exit codes, source identities, and distribution metadata.
Official ecosystem reference: [Qt 6 documentation, accessed 2026-09-24](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qopenglwidget.html).
Source CI, export dispatch, artifact delivery, and rendered parity are separate evidence dimensions.
A successful dispatch or unit-test summary does not establish a full rendered gate.

## 5. Open compatibility limits

Next bounded check: First retain raw acceptance evidence for the reopened closure-verification entries. Run the existing overlay comparisons with port-generated overlays on each claimed platform; keep GAP-040 visible. Then run the full existing sweep against immutable current authority inputs, report exact and tolerance results separately, and test installed GUI resize, context recreation, input errors, and recovery on the missing hosts.
See the stable entries in [completion gaps](COMPLETION_GAPS.md).

See [GAP-001 and the complete gap register](COMPLETION_GAPS.md#4-known-gaps) for evidence, dependencies, and acceptance criteria.

1. Reconcile the current authority and complete case inventory, including parameters, inputs, stateful frames, and host versions.
2. Run the existing actual-renderer suite without skip options. Record every missing, failed, refused, or timed-out case.
3. Verify installation, useful output, errors, recovery, upgrades, and removal with the actual distribution.
4. Inspect exact-source CI and retain artifact hashes. Keep unresolved qualification failed or unverified.

All eligible ports have equal priority. Full parity and zero skipped cases remain the goal.
Implementation corrections remain with the separate job. This report does not advance the parity checkpoint.
